The "game" folder contains the game assets I found, including characters, maps, sound effects, etc. I've implemented a simple map loading and camera movement. In the "test1" folder, various actions of the character, including turning and attacking, are implemented. I believe we can start developing the game using the assets in the "game/asset" directory. I will try to integrate all the recently completed code into one project.
