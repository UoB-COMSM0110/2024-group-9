Positives
- Like the menus, text and highlighting. 
- Basic physics seem good - feels natural.
- Levels are varied and intuitive.
- The weather effects are fun.


Negatives

Menus
-The character highlighting could be more clear.
-Can the credits scroll quicker?

Tutorial
-Not clear there's an incentive to kill the enemies or how to do it. Add something to the tutorial.
-Can the instructions go more slowly?

Game levels
- Occasional bug where the player gets stuck in the corner of a platform. 
- Weather seems a bit extreme, making it difficult to complete levels.
- Can't see a big difference between easy and difficult. 
- Reorder the levels to increase difficulty gradually.
- Ctrl+D (Dash and Move Right) puts you in debug mode and exits the game.
- When you hit into an enemy you lose a heart and the enemy dies. That's not right is it?
