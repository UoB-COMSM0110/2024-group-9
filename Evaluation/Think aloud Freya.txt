Menus
- I like the fonts and that it highlights - very clear
Tutorial
- Physics feels good
- Instructions - it would be better to wait a certain amount of time before the next instruction appears
Easy:
- You could have a loading screen before each level
- What are those faded out parts? Oh, they're the spaceship
- Feels bouncy and has in-air control which is nice
- Still have momentum when you turn - that's ok
- Is there a way of killing these guys? 
- It might be good to see the calculation of the score
- This one is a lit slower - it's harder to do (icy level)
- Maybe dash is a little too weighty
- Definitely need a wind graphic
- There's no cool-down indicator for the dash
- Magnitude of the wind is maybe a bit much
- When you hit into an enemy you lose a heart and the enemy dies. That's not right is it?
- It would be good to have a way to restart the current level
- Love the leaderboard
Difficult:
- The sprites are moving faster
- I've not really found a use case for the dash
- Levels are varied and intuitive in their structure
- Not so much the enemies
- Don't really see the difference between easy and hard. Maybe make the magnitude of the weather different or don't reset hearts in difficult?
