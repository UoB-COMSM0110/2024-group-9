Menus
- Love the text and highlighting
- Should I be doing the tutorial or? Maybe put tutorial first on the menu?
- Make the credits scroll quicker
- I love the characters!
- Weird way of showing which character is highlighted
Easy
- Vertical collision is really good
- Oh my god this is so stressful!
- Spaceship part wasn't super intuitive
- I love the snow effect
- Is there any incentive to kill the enemies?
- I like the bounce physics for killing enemies - it makes it very satisfying
Difficult
- It doesn't seem that different. The easy version is maybe a bit too hard.
