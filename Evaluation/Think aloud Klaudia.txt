Menus
- I like the background and the game credits idea.
- I like that you can change the keys. 
Tutorial
- Is this the time? (Framerate)
Game levels
- I like the level titles
- Monsters are hard
- Ah it remembered my name, that's nice
- I like that I get my lives back
- Struggling with the easy one!
- Like the mystery of what the next level will look like
- I don't like the icy one, but I like the idea behind it - it might be too extreme
- Don't see that big of a difference between easy and difficult
- Oh ok so there's wind coming from this way
- I like the wind idea but maybe make the platforms longer
- The monsters moved faster in difficult mode
- I think fog should be level 2 because it's easier than ice and wind
- Ctrl+D puts you in debug mode and exits the game
